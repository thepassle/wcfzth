            Let's start using lit-html to do our rendering for us!

            In the `PokemonApp` component:
                - Empty the contents of the `_renderPokemon(listOfPokeemon)` method
                - use lit-html's `render()` function to render our h1 header, and our list of pokemon, to `this.shadowRoot`
                - use the javascript `.map` array method to render thee list of pokemon
                - set the `.url` property on the `<pokemon-card>` (see the reference links down below)
                - set the `name` attribute on the `<pokemon-card>` (see the reference links down below)
                - get rid of any querySelectors in your component

                For reference you can always take a look at the solution, or at these relevant links:
