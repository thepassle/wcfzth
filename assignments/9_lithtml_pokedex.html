            Let's remove some imperative code:

                - remove the code for creation of a template tag, and setting innerHTML on it
                - in the constructor, remove the call to `shadowRoot.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));`

                - do this for both components

                !! ðŸš¨ Note that this step will break your code, but it's fine for now â€” we're just doing some cleanup, and we'll fix everything in the next assignment ðŸš¨ !!

                For reference you can always take a look at the solution
