            You're doing great! Getting tired of writing boilerplate yet? No worries! We're going to make things much easier from here on out

                - Let's import lit-html from the following url:
                    `import { html, render } from 'https://unpkg.com/lit-html?module';`

                - Log `html` and `render` to the console to make sure we have everything imported correctly

                For reference you can always take a look at the solution, or at these relevant links:
